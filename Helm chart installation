1: Install Helm Chart Using Script

If you like doing everything from scratch then I would suggest you to install the Helm Chart Using script.

Run the following scripts -

commands for install helm ......


  ->   curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3            //step1
next
 ->   chmod 700 get_helm.sh                                                                                 //step2

next  (...this command for install the helm successdully...)

 ->   ./get_helm.sh                                                                             //step3


Now check the helm version by using the below command

    ->   helm version                                                                //step4                                         
 

....now you see the out put like....

"     
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.18.4", GitCommit:"d80839cf37d860c8aa9a0503fe463278f26cd5e2", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.24.4"}
